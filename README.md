# qlqw

This repository contains two plugins for [Quod Libet].

*   `qlqw.py` (the Quod Libet Queue Writer) dumps your queue into
    `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` on every song change.
*   `aast.py` ("Always Avail Song Title" - to `i3status`, that is)
    writes the title of the now-playing song to a fixed file in
    `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` on every song change.
